I always wanted to understand about react in depth, understand it's internal working. There are indeed 
really great resources out there but non of them feel so connected when i first started exploring, 
many informations are just conflicting too, i guess it's cause of how react has evolved in years too
This resource is also based on the react 18.0.1 more, react internal might change in future how they work
what they do, but your best bet is to give time explore things. when you read one article and try to follow other it 
feels different and you are in roundabout, so i spent some time learning react internals, 
exploring things and wrote a series of blog that i wishedwas there for me to study. I will try my best to explain 
things.
