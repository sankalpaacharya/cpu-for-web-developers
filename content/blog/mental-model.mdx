## Mental Model

When you're learning React, it helps to have a mental model of what's actually happening under the hood. React isn't just a templating library – it's a **runtime** that manages your UI.

Think of it this way: instead of you manually telling the browser what to change, you describe **what the UI should look like**, and React figures out how to make it happen.


how to write this part 
- showing people the painpoint of the manual dom manupliation and how hard it is to change the state manually 
- showing what exactly react does to solve this pain point 
- if it's UI library what exactly is the UI. UI is justa tree like structure and the main idea of the react is so change the 
UI structure it just tells how out UI should look like at a particular time, that is why we have different react renderer
showing few renderer like maybe a react native or some hardware level stuff, or maybe a pdf would be better
once people understand what exactly is react and what it is doing we can movve to other 


I would like to divide the react into two parts -
- react core 
- react renderer 



ok so 
we will start with the the pain point of the dom manupliation( browser pain, single thread and etc) 
we will talk about the fiber and single thread when we will talk about the fiber later on but rn it's not necessary to 
discuss  up til that point 


show them what exactly is the UI library (my linkedin post for the reference)
i will do one think today that is write a single blog on why react is just a runtime post it in tech nepal 
get the people review one blog today, and once i explore more deeply i will share on reactiflux later on






personal note for me 
insert the dan blog here 
I think the dan has a great blog on this, we know react is a UI library, lets addcj
this on the reference i thin 

i think adding the reference at the end of the blog will more suitable then saying this blog helped me


React is a UI library? but let's understand the pain point of 

the reason i think the mental model matters more than before we even start talking about the react and the other 
internal things. 

I  


understadning of UI first i think that will make things more early


before we start the internal i think it's important for us to think what react actually is and how it does 
we know react is a UI library. is it so? 

let's think of react as the Runtime whic
