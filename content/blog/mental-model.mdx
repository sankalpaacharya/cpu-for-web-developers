## Mental Model

When you're learning React, it helps to have a mental model of what's actually happening under the hood. React isn't just a templating library – it's a **runtime** that manages your UI.

Think of it this way: instead of you manually telling the browser what to change, you describe **what the UI should look like**, and React figures out how to make it happen.

### Why This Matters

Understanding this model helps you:
- Write more predictable code
- Debug issues faster  
- Make better architectural decisions

## !!steps The Declarative Approach

React lets you describe your UI declaratively. You don't tell React *how* to update the DOM – you tell it *what* you want to see.

```jsx !code declarative.jsx
function Counter({ count }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <p>The count is {count > 10 ? 'high' : 'low'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## !!steps The Reconciliation Process

When state changes, React creates a new virtual representation and compares it with the previous one. This is called **reconciliation**.

```jsx !code reconciliation.jsx
// When count changes from 5 to 6:
// 
// OLD:  <h1>Count: 5</h1>
// NEW:  <h1>Count: 6</h1>
//
// React sees: "Only the text changed"
// React does: Update just that text node
```

## !!steps Batching Updates

React batches multiple state updates together for performance. This is why you can't rely on `state` being updated immediately.

```jsx !code batching.jsx
function handleClick() {
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  setCount(c => c + 1);
  
  // React batches these!
  // Only ONE re-render happens
  // count goes from 0 → 3
}
```

</Scrollycoding>

## Key Takeaways

Now that you understand React as a runtime, remember these principles:

1. **React manages updates** – you describe, it executes
2. **Virtual DOM is a strategy** – not a feature you interact with directly
3. **Batching is automatic** – trust the runtime to optimize

In the next post, we'll dive deeper into how React Fiber makes all of this possible.
