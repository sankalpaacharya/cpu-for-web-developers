                    Hello 👋, I’m <strong>Sankalpa (sanku)</strong>. I’m 21 years old and have been super excited about computers ever since I was a kid.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m originally from <strong>Nepal 🇳🇵</strong> and currently pursuing my <strong>B.Tech</strong> in <strong>Gujarat, India 🇮🇳</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started programming back in <strong>2020</strong> during high school, where I dove into bug bounties and cybersecurity. Later, when I joined college in <strong>2022</strong>, I shifted my focus toward building web applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m actively looking for a new opportunity.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
    );
}
